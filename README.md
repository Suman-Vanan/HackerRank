# My solutions to HackerRank challenges

Check out my HackerRank [profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/suman_vanan).

Solutions are written in Ruby.

There may be multiple solutions for each problem. If so, the largest numbered solution is the most efficient one.

Particularly problematic test cases have been included. If test cases are included, the code should use those test cases and print output to the console. 
If no test cases are included, then the code would only work in HackerRank in-browser code editor, against their test cases.

I have tried to incude comments to explain my thought process. Hopefully, that's sufficient to grasp the logic behind the solution.

Good luck, & have fun! :sunglasses:
