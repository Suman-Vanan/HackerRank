# My solutions to HackerRank challenges

Check out my HackerRank [profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/suman_vanan).

Solutions are written in Ruby.

There may be multiple solutions for each problem. If so, the largest numbered solution is the most efficient one.

I have tried to incude comments to explain my thought process. Hopefully, that's sufficient to grasp the logic behind the solution.
